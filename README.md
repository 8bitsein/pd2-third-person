# pd2-third-person
Experimental BLT mod that implements and enables third person mode

## WARNING
This is highly experimental and may (at some point) crash your game. There are also some issues that that I have yet to find the cause for to be able to fix them.

## Known issues
- Third person unit sometimes stops syncing positions correctly after some actions (jumping usually fixes it)
- Sometimes animations are bugged after being helped up
- Animations are incorrect on ziplines
- Aiming in third person is difficult since the aim point is not the screen center
