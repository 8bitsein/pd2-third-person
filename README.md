# pd2-third-person
Experimental BLT mod that implements and enables third person mode

## Warning!
This is highly experimental and may (at some point) crash your game. There are also some issues with the player model not updating its position correctly after some actions (jumping will fix it most of the times) and probably others that have yet to be figured out and fixed.
