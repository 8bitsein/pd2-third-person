# pd2-third-person
Experimental BLT mod that implements and enables third person mode

## WARNING
This is highly experimental and may (at some point) crash your game. There are also some issues that that I have yet to find the cause for to be able to fix them.

## Known issues
- Animations are incorrect on ziplines and during jumping
- Aiming in third person is difficult since the aim point is not the screen center
- Drop in clients will see 2 player models of you, the real one and one at the position of where you were at when they spawned in
